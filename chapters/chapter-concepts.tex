\label{sec:concepts:ml}

\section{Task definition}
\label{sec:concepts:tasks}
Although the posed task for this thesis is pretty clear from its formulation we want to quickly distinguish the similar but different image understanding tasks that are solved using these techniques.

The first task that was tackled is \textbf{image classification}. In image classification the data are images containing a single object that fills most of the image. Hence the task is to find the class of that singular object which thus describes the whole image. Since 2015 \glspl{cnn} can surpass the performance of humans doing classification \citep{he_delving_2015}.

Next \textbf{object localization} was addressed. Localization means that we still have only one relevant object per image but here the object fills only a part of the image. Instead of only predicting the class of this object the localizer also has to predict translation and scaling for each image.

Harder to solve but also way more applicable is \textbf{object detection}. Now we take complicated images containing a variable number of overlapping objects each of varying class. The detector identifies all objects he was trained for inside each image and predicts their boundaries.

Lastly we have \textbf{image segmentation}. Here we aim to not only identify multiple different object in a image but also to find their boundaries on the pixel level. As such each pixel of a found object in the image is labeled with its class id resulting in multiple binary masks each masking out one individual object.

\section{Neural Networks}

\subsection{Convolutions} % (fold)
\label{sub:conepts:nn:conv}

\subsection{Activation Functions} % (fold)
\label{sub:conepts:nn:activations}

    \end{tabulary}
    \caption{The effect of \gls{relu} visualized. The green activations are positive and the purple ones are negative.}
\end{figure}
\gls{conv} layers return the response of their inputs to their filters. The next step is to output how the neuron at each position inside the receptive field was activated. This is done by the activation function $f(x)$. In the most simple cases this could by the identity $f(x) = x$ or the unit step function $f(x) = (\sign x + 1) / 2$. With the identity we just use the response values as activations not introducing any more complexity and the sign removes almost all information.

As shown before convolutions are linear operations. A chain of convolutions would still return a linear classifier but we know that working on raw pixel values from our images it will in the most cases be impossible to linearly separate the different classes \citep{lecun_deep_2015}. To discriminate such representation we need a non-linear division boundary and thus a \gls{cnn} should be a composite of linear and non-linear operations so that at least in theory it can approximate the non-linear representation.

\subsection{Pooling}
\label{sub:concepts:nn:pooling}
A typical building block for \glspl{cnn} is the triple of a \gls{conv} layer followed by a non-linear activation function followed by a pooling layer. The pooling layer takes its input from the previous layer and compresses spatially into into a smaller form. Different function can be applied to the data neighborhood from the input. Average pooling \citep{lecun_handwritten_1990} or max pooling \citep{zhou_computation_1988} are two of the most prominent ones. With average pooling we return the average of the values from the neighborhood and with max pooling we return the maximum value from the neighborhood.

It is important to note that average pooling is a linear function while max pooling is not. \glspl{cnn} should compose a non-linear function. Thus pooling is often used to introduce more non-linearity and therefore max pooling is more popular to use. Also as downsampling of the deep filters can be done with strided convolutions alone pooling is not necessary for this and more and more network architectures drop the pooling layers entirely \citep{springenberg_striving_2014}.

\subsection{Regularization} % (fold)
\label{sub:conepts:nn:regularization}

\subsection{Batch Normalization} % (fold)
\label{sub:conepts:nn:batchnorm}
Batch normalization \citep{ioffe_batch_2015} is a method the ease the computation of gradient decent in backpropagation. Inside a deep neural network emerges the problem of internal covariate shift. Each deeper layer of the network depends on the outputs from its previous layer. The first layer learns on top of the data input but the second layer learns from the output of the first layers features and the third layer depends on the second one and so on. In training all these features change through backpropagation and the distribution of all activations change and the deeper the layer is the longer the chain of evolving distributions in front of it becomes.\\
If the features in training shift over time the gradient decent becomes harder as each layer has to follow this covariate shift of its successor. BatchNorm helps to avoid this difficulty by normalizing mini batches of inputs. The layer is added after a convolutional layer (or any other linear layer) and collects a batch of inputs $X = \{x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n\}$ for this layers inputs. Then it calculates the mean $\mu_X$ and the variance $\sigma_X^2$ for this mini batch. Normalizing all the values from that batch  with
\begin{equation}
    \hat{x_i} = \frac{x_i - \mu_X}{\sqrt{\sigma_X^2 + \epsilon}}
\end{equation}
($\epsilon$ is added to avoid divisions by zero) yields the output $\{\hat{x_1},\dots,\hat{x_n}\}$.\\
To use the BatchNorm parameters while testing we compute a moving average over the means and variances of the batches while training. The forward pass uses these averages to normalize the test inputs.

\section{Fully Convolutional Networks}
\label{sec:concepts:fcn}
Proposed by \citet{long_fully_2015} \glspl{fcn} are a specific architecture of CNNs. Fully convolutional states that the network consists only of convolutional layers. As these are translation invariant the networks can take arbitrarily sized inputs and produce a coarse output.

\subsection{Deconvolution} % (fold)
\label{sub:conepts:fcn:deconv}
Deconvolution or often called transposed convolution, first used by \citet{zeiler_deconvolutional_2010}, introduces a new operation for neural networks.
\input{figures/conv_deconv}
For images the output size of a deconvolutional (deconv) layer is calculated with the inverse formula for the output size of a convolutional layer. The stride defines the upsampling factor of this layer, the kernel size the ratio of 'overlapiness' and the padding is set accordingly.

\subsection{Fully convolutional network} % (fold)
\label{sub:conepts:fcn:fcn}
The original authors use this architecture for image segmentation. They build their network from classic semantic object classifiers like VGG-16 \citep{simonyan_very_2014}. These take fixed sized images as inputs and produce a single label thereby classifying the whole image. Typically these networks produce high level features through a series of convolutional layers and classify them with a single or a series of \gls{fc} layers. To label an image pixel-wise with such an architecture we would have to forward the neighborhood of each pixel through the network which would introduce an \bigO{w * h} time complexity ($w$ and $h$ being the width and the height of the image).

\subsection{Conversion of \gls{fc} layers}
\label{sub:concepts:fcn:fc_conversion}
\gls{fc} layers can directly be converted into \gls{conv} layers which makes \glspl{fcn} immensely efficient.\\
To understand this process let us examine the VGG-16 network. After the 13 \gls{conv} layers and 5 max-pooling layers we get an output from \texttt{pool5} with size $512\times7\times7$. Through pooling the original images ($224\times224$) got reduced to $7\times7$ images over 512 channels. These go though 3 \gls{fc} layers. The first \gls{fc} layer returns 4096 values. We replace it with a \gls{conv} layer with kernel size 7 and 4096 channels thus resulting also in $1\times1\times4096$ output volume. The weights from the \gls{fc} layer can be reshaped into the size of the \gls{conv} layer. The other two \gls{fc} layers with 4096 and 1000 outputs, respectively can directly be put into convolutions with kernel size 1.

For the normal $224\times224$ images nothing changed as the output of the first \gls{fc} layer is still the 4096 values but if we now increase the data size to e.g. the double $448\times448$ the advantage becomes apparent. The \texttt{pool5} will return $14\times14$ images and the new \gls{conv} layer will just slide over the bigger images returning $8\times8$ images. Lastly the other $1\times1$ convolutions do not change the size so that we get 64 predictions over the 1000 classes instead of one. These are the same as if we would have slided a window over the original image with an $8\times8$ grid but because the computations on the GPU are shared for the $7\times7$ kernels we heavily increased performance compared to the na√Øve solution.

\subsection{Upsampling through Convolutions}
\label{sub:concepts:fcn:upsampling}
A \gls{fcn} as in \citep{long_fully_2015} outputs a small sparse score map. For an input image of $200\times 200$ pixels that could be something like $10\times 10$ values. Naturally we want a output map with the same size as the input. Firstly we can use feature maps from earlier layers with their own classifiers to reduce the stride of the resulting score map but the score map from deeper layers has still to be upsampled to the input size. Upsampling can be done directly within the network with convolutions. It is possible to use deconvolutions to upsample the inputs and filter them at the same time but this often introduces artifacts \citep{odena_deconvolution_2016} and to learn the upsampling instead of using directly bilinear kernels does not help much in performance \citep{shelhamer_fully_2016}. It seems successful to upsample the score maps with normal interpolation followed by normal convolutions \citep{dong_image_2016}.

\section{Residual Networks}
\label{sec:concepts:resnet}
After the succes of AlexNet \citep{krizhevsky_imagenet_2012} and with the possibilities of fast GPU computing neural networks got deeper and bigger.
The VGG-16 by \citet{simonyan_very_2014} has 442.5 million trainable parameters for its 16 layers. The more parameters a network has the harder the training becomes.
Since the last years multiple new network architectures were developed that achieve higher accuracy with less parameters and therefore shorter inference time \citep{canziani_analysis_2016}. One of those architectures are \gls{resnet} by \citet{he_deep_2016} with which they won the COCO  \citet{lin_microsoft_2014} and the ImageNet \citet{russakovsky_imagenet_2015} object detection challenges in 2015.
A \gls{conv} layer in a standard feed forward network learns a mapping $\mathcal{H}(x)$ from its input $x$. When training the network we reach the point at which the accuracy saturates. At this point the layers which are further trained should approximate a identity mapping of their inputs as the optimum has already been reached. In practice with deep networks new layers at some point in training rapidly mode away from the identity they should learn and degrade the training error after it already saturated. Thus making these networks deeper will worsen their results \citep{he_convolutional_2015}.
\input{figures/resblock}

The main idea of \glspl{resnet} is pretty simple. They are build from many small identical blocks of which one example is shown in \figreft{fig:resblock}. Instead of blocks that learn the mapping $\mathcal{H}(x)$ we introduce blocks that learn the \textit{residual} $\mathcal{F}(x) = \mathcal{H}(x) - x$ of this mapping. For that we add skip connections between the input and the output of these blocks so that the input can be added to the residual that is the output of the \gls{conv} layers. Learning the residual instead of the actually mapping has the advantage that if new \gls{conv} layers are added and stay unlearned the whole residual block still yields the identity mapping which will not lead to the degradation problem we see with normal deep networks.

\subsection{Network design}
\label{sec:concepts:resnet:design}
Using the basic concept of residual blocks we build a successful architecture. First lets look at what the blocks can contain. The first example in \figreft{fig:resblock} uses just two \gls{conv} layers and a \gls{relu} to learn the residual. Therefore the block is described by:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{F}(x) = W_2\sigma(W_1 x + b_1) + b_2
\end{equation}
The $W_i$ and $b_i$ denote the weights and biases for the two layers, respectively and the $\sigma$ denotes the \gls{relu} layer thus making the block non-linear. Actually any chain of layers could be used to model the residual mapping. One could use this technique with just one \gls{conv} layer but as the original authors \citep{he_deep_2016} depict, this will just result in a normal linear projection which does not improve performance compared to a normal network.

Deeper networks will become more complex. We want to limit the increase in complexity. This can be done with bottleneck blocks as the second example in \figreft{fig:resblock}. Here we use $1\times1$ \gls{conv} layers to first reduce the dimensionality of the input and to increase it again to the inputs dimension. The actual mapping convolution now has a smaller input dimension.
\input{figures/resnet50}
For this work we use the 50-layered \gls{resnet} as described in the original paper. Its architecture is shown in \figreft{fig:resnet50}.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:concepts:eval}
The result of this work is a binary object detector. Therefore a test run of the detector will result in a set of $n$ boxes $B_p$ that the method predicts as positive (object of the class the classifier was trained on) with probabilities $p_p \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. For the test set of images we know the actual ground truth boxes $B_g$ of this class. With some defined condition we mark the predicted boxes $B_p$ as true positive or false negative. The boxes from $B_g$ that were not predicted as positives by the detector are false negatives.

\subsubsection{Precision and Recall}
One way to evaluate a binary detector to plot the precision recall curves. Precision is defined as the proportion of the predicted positives that are actual positives:
\begin{equation}
    \textit{precision} = \frac{|B_p \cap B_g|}{|B_g|}
\end{equation}
Therefore a detector which does not predict any positives would have perfect precision even though it is obviously bad. The counteracting measure to use is the recall. Recall or also called \gls{tpr} states the proportion of all ground truth positives that are predicted positives:
\begin{equation}
    \textit{recall} = \textit{tpr} = \frac{|B_p \cap B_g|}{|B_p|}
\end{equation}
Here a detector that predicts only positives will receive perfect recall and as such we want a model with high precision and high recall.

Our detector returns probability scores for each positive predicted box and therefore we have to select an cut-off value for accepting positives. Now we can analyze how precision and recall change will we change this threshold. This transition is plotted in the precision-recall curve in which we plot precision against recall over the changing discrimination value.

\subsubsection{\gls{roc}}
Another often employed evaluation method are \gls{roc} curves and their \gls{auc}. For the \gls{roc} we pose the \gls{tpr} which tells how many of the positives we detected as positives against the \gls{fpr} which tells how many of the negatives were predicted as false positives. \gls{tpr} tells the probability that we hit a positive and \gls{fpr} tells the probability of an false alarm.

Plotting \gls{tpr} against \gls{fpr} over the changing discrimination threshold the same way as the precision-recall curve returns the \gls{roc} curve. The perfect detector would have a \gls{tpr} of 1 and a \gls{fpr} of 0 therefore we want a detector approaching this point of perfect classification. The \gls{roc} space reaches from 0 to 1 over both axes. A randomly guessing detector maps to the diagonal in this plot which as such is the discriminator between good and bad models.

To even summarize this metric more we calculate and report the \gls{auc} values for the different models. As the name states the \gls{auc} is the area under the \gls{roc} curve with values in $[0, 1]$. Because the random classifier returns the diagonal inside the \gls{roc} space the \gls{auc} value can be interpreted as the probability that a detector will score a positive ground truth sample higher than a negative one. With \gls{auc} of 1 that would be perfect with 0.5 it would be random. We calculate the \gls{auc} with the trapezoidal rule applied to the \gls{roc} curve.
