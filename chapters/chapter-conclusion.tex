\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This thesis presents a image retrieval system employing a \acrlong{fcn} for efficient object detection. For this the underlying \gls{resnet} is quickly and without the objective of convergence fine-tuned with a set of heavily augmented versions of the query image. The linear classifier is converted to a convolutional operator to perform sparse class probability prediction on images of any size. Using these probability maps we predict the existence of the query object inside larger images and yield those patches.

Although the method proved successful in finding similar objects with only few or only one query image to train from, we the presented method ha
